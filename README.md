## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

️**Title**: `DJ Z Play list manager`

**Purpose**: `The Playlist Manager project creates a program that organizes and manages playlists, 
allowing users to sort songs by genre, artist, or mood, as well as add, remove, and shuffle songs, 
and quickly retrieve songs with a search function.
`

️**Source Assignment(s)**: `HW02,HW05: Funky Functions, Fun Exams,T10: Intro to Classes`

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:
  
![Don't leave me in your README!](image/crcimg.png "Image of CRC card as an example. Upload your CRC card(s) in place of this one. ")

**Branches**:

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

```
    I feel very behind and and far from the rest of my classmates.im actually wanting to change my project but we will see how fara long i get
    with this one but i really want to get a product out by the end of this class so i can get as much assistance as possible.

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In


**Completion Percentage**: `0 - 100%`

️**Confidence**: 

```
Completion Percentage: 75%

The core features of the playlist manager, including song addition, removal, searching, sorting, shuffling, and file uploads, 
are implemented. Remaining tasks include testing the program, creating the UI, adding error handling, and integrating audio playback, 
where there is the ability to play the song of choice. I'm confident about completing the project, as most of the main 
functionality is already in place, and the remaining work mainly involves refining and testing. 
To ensure success, I'll focus on testing and potentially adding audio playback or a more user-friendly interface if time permits.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
To use this program, start by clicking the "Run" button in PyCharm. The application will launch, allowing you to manage your playlists. 
You can add songs by specifying the details, remove songs, shuffle your playlist, or search for specific songs using the provided interface.

### Errors and Constraints
There are some known bugs and constraints that will be documented in the issue queue. 
Any undocumented errors or deficiencies found will be addressed as they arise.

### Reflection
I selected this project to explore my interest in music management tools and create a user-friendly application for organizing playlists. The final project aligns reasonably well with my initial design, although certain features evolved during development due to technical challenges and time constraints. 

This process taught me valuable lessons in project management, time allocation, and problem-solving. The hardest part was balancing feature implementation with testing and debugging, especially as the deadline approached.

If I could redo the project, I would allocate more time for testing and user interface design from the start, knowing how critical these elements are for user satisfaction.
Collaborating with a partner has been beneficial; clear communication and a mutual understanding of tasks facilitated our progress. 
Challenges arose during merging branches, but we managed to resolve them effectively.
